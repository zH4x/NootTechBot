```erl
1. No spamming bot commands (spam prevention will be implimented soon) - this will result in a verbal warning & eventually a kick/ban.

2. No adding 'meme' songs to the playlist (i.e. 'Vine Compilations', 'Minecraft Lets Plays' etc) - these will be force skipped by an Admin without reason. IF you continue to do this, you may be Bot Banned.

IF it is just yourself and a few friends in a channel, add whatever you want. Just Do Not clutter full music playlists with Meme Related content - such content will be force skipped by admins during times like this.

3. Hourlong+ videos will ONLY play for 8 MINUTES before auto-skipping.

4. No abusing search functions (such as !google, !youtube) - any form of bot abuse (such as searching NSFW content) will result in warnings & kick/bans``` For a list of commands, type !help !admin !translate? or !music in the <#224598020107272203> chat.
